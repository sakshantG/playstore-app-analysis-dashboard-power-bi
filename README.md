💥 Presenting Playstore App Analysis which is part of Capstone Project by Almabetter .

Google play store is immersed with a few thousands of new applications regularly with a progressively huge number of designers working freely or on the other hand in a group to make them successful, with the enormous challenge from everywhere throughout the globe. In this project, we were provided with two datasets i.e play store data & user reviews.

Before creating dashboard in power bi, I also perform EDA on the given dataset in Python using various libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
